## Decision Points & Notes

- **Identity (workforce vs customer).** Azure AD/Entra spans both; in AWS/GCP, split between workforce SSO (Identity Center/Cloud Identity) and customer identity (Cognito/Identity Platform).  
- **SIEM.** Azure has a first‑party SIEM (**Sentinel**). GCP offers **Chronicle**. AWS relies on **Security Lake + OpenSearch or partner SIEM**; plan for architecture/operations accordingly.  
- **Policy Controls.** Azure Policy supports **deny/deployIfNotExists**; AWS uses **SCPs** for org‑wide guardrails and **Config** for evaluation & remediation; GCP’s **Org Policy** enforces hierarchical constraints.  
- **Cost.** All platforms charge primarily on **ingestion/retention/scan volume** for logs and security analytics. Commitment/usage tiers can materially reduce cost. Always model projected ingest and retention.

---

## DevSecOps Integration Cheatsheet

- **IaC:** Azure (ARM/Bicep/Terraform), AWS (CloudFormation/CDK/Terraform), GCP (Deployment Manager/Terraform).  
- **Pipelines:** GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, AWS CodePipeline, Cloud Build.  
- **Eventing/Automation:** Azure (Logic Apps/Event Grid), AWS (EventBridge/Lambda/Step Functions), GCP (Eventarc/Cloud Functions/Workflows).  
- **Data Flow to SIEM:** Use native connectors/sinks (e.g., Diagnostics settings → Log Analytics/Sentinel; CloudWatch/CloudTrail → Security Lake/OpenSearch; Cloud Logging → Chronicle/BigQuery).
